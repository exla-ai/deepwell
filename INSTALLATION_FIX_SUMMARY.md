# Deepwell Installation Fix Summary

## Changes Made to Fix Installation Issues

### 1. **pyproject.toml**
- **Removed** `torch>=2.0.0` and `nvidia-cutlass>=3.5.0` from `[build-system]` requires
- These are runtime dependencies, not build-time dependencies
- Fixes the issue where pip would try to download 888MB PyTorch during build
- Fixed `classifiers` configuration (was incorrectly nested under `[project.classifiers]`)

### 2. **setup.py**
- **Added** conditional torch import with `DEEPWELL_NO_BUILD_EXTENSIONS` support
- **Made** C++ extension building optional
- **Added** fallback for when PyTorch is not available during build
- **Fixed** CUDA detection to not fail when CUDA is unavailable
- **Added** support for Python-only installation mode

### 3. **New Environment Variable**
- `DEEPWELL_NO_BUILD_EXTENSIONS=1` - Skip building C++ extensions
- Useful for testing or when build dependencies are problematic

## Installation Methods Now Supported

### Standard Installation (with C++ extensions if possible)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/exla-ai/deepwell.git
```

### Python-only Installation (no C++ extensions)
```bash
DEEPWELL_NO_BUILD_EXTENSIONS=1 pip install git+https://github.com/exla-ai/deepwell.git
```

### Installation with existing PyTorch
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/exla-ai/deepwell.git --no-build-isolation
```

## Test Results

✅ Library can now be installed successfully
✅ Import works correctly
✅ Model optimization functionality works
✅ CUDA/Blackwell GPU detection works
⚠️  CUTLASS kernels not built in Python-only mode (expected)

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Faster Installation** - No need to download PyTorch if already installed
2. **More Robust** - Handles missing dependencies gracefully
3. **Flexible** - Can install Python-only version if C++ build fails
4. **Network Friendly** - Reduces download requirements
5. **Better Error Messages** - Clear warnings about what's missing

## Recommendation for Next Steps

1. Push these changes to the main repository
2. Consider creating pre-built wheels for common platforms
3. Add CI/CD to test installation on different environments
4. Update README with new installation instructions
